- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

The public/private part of 'Encapsulation' was a little confusing to me because it felt like it was necessary for the majority of things to be public, so I think I didn't fully understand when to choose what. Other than that I enjoyed figuring out how to go about this project -- the concept of it was fun to me. However there were a lot of sticky places where
it was easy to get confused/the code to get bugged. I'd recommend for students doing this class in the future to start coding early so you can let some of the concepts/goals marinate in your mind a little bit -- trying to do all four parts in one go would definitly not be the move! This is the kind of project that requires incremental work. I think the code that Ab showed us in class Tuesday (when introducing the project) was very helpful to the project as a whole -- not just Engine.jave, I definitely would have been lost without it/not known how to start.
